# Disease-Predictor
Using Machine Learning to Predict Diseases from Symptoms in Python where CSV files were trained

**Motivation:**

Our goal is to design and deploy a decision-support tool using AI capabilities which will mainly be
predictive analysis to flag future clinical corona severity. We hope that the tool, when fully developed,
will be useful to the physicians as they assess which moderately ill patients really need bed, what type of
disease a person has, who can be treated from home. This type of tool may really help as hospital
resources are stretched in. Using already designed computer models or maneuvering them into
something new, predictions can be made. These computer models will make decision using the data fed
into them. By using technology to predict and diagnose diseases, it can serve as a bridge between
people and the health sector by providing accurate results on basis of their history/symptoms in an
efficient, cheaper and advanced way.

**Techniques/Methods:**

• Decision trees can be used that track series of decisions between options and that model the
potential consequences of choices at each step in a pathway.
• Ensemble learning technique can also be used for predicting. Ensemble is another type of
supervised learning. It means combining the predictions of multiple machine learning models
that are individually weak to produce a more accurate prediction on a new sample
• Pandas, Numpy and Sklearn libraries
• Tkinter GUI library
• KNN Classifier
• CNN Classifier
• MLP Classifier
• Random Forest Classifier
• Naïve Bayes Classifier can be used to calculate the probability of the diseases occurring.

**Experiments:**

• Training and testing on various data sets
• Using and comparing multiple classifiers for best predictions
• Making a GUI using Tkinter or other libraries
• Improving the accuracy of the code by classification, preprocessing and further enhancement
techniques.
